# SPA-file-reader

SPA is the default file type of Thermo Scientific(TM) OMNIC Series Software(TM). These files store infrared (IR) spectral data in a binary format, which makes data analysis and processing nearly impossible without OMNIC Series Software(TM).

As a student without home access to OMNIC software (and who saved all of his IR spectral data in the SPA format), I need a way to extract my spectrum and save it in a human-readable format. Thankfully, a Cprogramming user, JonathanS, put together a functional C++ program capable of extracting these data (link: https://cboard.cprogramming.com/cplusplus-programming/152474-reading-ir-spectrosopy-file-spa-file-unknown-binary-file.html); SPA-file-reader is a continuation of Jonathan's work.

Currently, this program is entirely capable of converting the SPA files found in the 'SPA-Files' folder to CSV files. It is unlikely, however, that this program will work as-is for SPA files generated by a different spectrometer; a small amount of effort would need to be put forth in order to determine the offset addresses where transmission/absorption data begins and ends.

# Using this program

Assuming a user has access to the g++ compiler, they may compile and run this program by doing the following:

1. Download the get-ir-mwv.cpp source file.

2. From a terminal, change directory to the folder which contains the downloaded source file.

3. Compile the source file into an executable with the following command:

    '''
    g++ get-ir-mwv.cpp -o get-ir-mwv
    '''
    
4. Move the SPA file from which data should be extracted into the directory containing the executable.

5. Run the executable on the SPA file with the following command: (replace <SPA Filename> with the name of your SPA file)

    '''
    ./get-ir-mwv <SPA Filename>
    '''
    
Example:

    '''
    ./get-ir-mwv 0min-1-97C.SPA
    '''

If everything works, the user should now have a new file in the current directory named <SPA Filename>.CSV which contains the extracted transmission or absorption data.

If a user has multiple SPA files in the same directory, they may move the executable into that directory and process all SPA files at once by typing the following into a bash terminal:

    '''
    for f in *.SPA
    do
        ./get-ir-mwv f
    end
    '''
