# SPA-file-reader

SPA is the default file type of Thermo Scientific(TM) OMNIC Series Software(TM). These files store infrared (IR) spectral data in a binary format, which makes data analysis and processing nearly impossible without OMNIC Series Software(TM).

As a student without home access to OMNIC software (and who saved all of his IR spectral data in the SPA format) I need a way to extract my spectrum and save it in a human-readable format. Thankfully, a Cprogramming user, JonathanS, put together a functional C++ program capable of extracting these data (link: https://cboard.cprogramming.com/cplusplus-programming/152474-reading-ir-spectrosopy-file-spa-file-unknown-binary-file.html); SPA-file-reader is a continuation of Jonathan's work.
